This repository contains a sample end-to-end application built with the following technologies:

- An **Angular 18** front end which has been deployed to Amazon S3 and is served via Amazon Cloudfront. The front end is integrated with **Okta OpenID Connect** for authentication.
- A **.NET Core 8.0** API RESTFUL layer which has been containerized and deployed to **Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)/Fargate**.
- An **Amazon Aurora Postgres** cluster for data storage.

The example application has been bootstrapped with **.NET Aspire**.

The example application is not meant to be fully functional or production-ready but rather to demonstrate facility with the technologies proposed in this response.

The application has been deployed in AWS [here](https://fps.cgi-ne-demo.com/).
